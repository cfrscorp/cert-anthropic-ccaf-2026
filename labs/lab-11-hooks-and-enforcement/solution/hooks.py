"""Reference implementation: Agent SDK hooks and workflow enforcement.

This module implements the four programmatic-enforcement primitives from Task
Statements 1.5 (hooks for interception and normalization) and 1.4 (prerequisite
gates and structured handoffs) of the CCAF exam guide:

- ``post_tool_use_normalize`` — a ``PostToolUse``-style hook that rewrites a raw
  tool result into one canonical shape *before the model ever sees it*, so the
  agent reasons over uniform ISO-8601 timestamps and human-readable status
  labels instead of a mix of Unix ints, ISO strings, and numeric HTTP codes.
- ``intercept_tool_call`` — an outgoing-tool-call interception hook that blocks a
  policy-violating action (a refund above ``refund_limit``) and redirects it to
  human escalation. This is a *deterministic* guarantee: the rule holds on every
  call regardless of how the model was prompted.
- ``PrerequisiteGate`` — enforces ordering: ``process_refund`` is blocked until
  ``get_customer`` has returned a *verified* ``customer_id``. This is the
  programmatic answer to Sample Question 1 (a prerequisite gate beats a
  prompt/few-shot instruction when errors have financial consequences).
- ``build_handoff`` — compiles a structured escalation summary for a human agent
  who has no access to the conversation transcript.

Why hooks instead of prompt instructions? Prompt-based compliance is
*probabilistic*: it has a non-zero failure rate that is unacceptable for identity
verification and money movement. Hooks run in code, so they give *deterministic*
guarantees.

This is an importable module (no shell entry point), so it carries docstrings but
is exempt from the PEP 723 / argparse script conventions.

    left absent — the hook never fabricates data.

    failure rate) — it is a programmatic prerequisite that makes the unsafe path
