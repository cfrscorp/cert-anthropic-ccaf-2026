"""Few-shot prompting & explicit criteria (Lab 06 reference solution).

Public API (identical in starter/ and solution/):

    build_review_prompt(criteria: list[str], few_shot: list[dict]) -> str
        Compose a code-review system prompt with (a) an explicit *categorical*
        criteria section (which issues to REPORT vs which to SKIP), (b) a concrete
        output format, and (c) 2-4 few-shot examples. Each example shows an input,
        the desired output, and WHY that choice beats a plausible alternative.

    has_explicit_criteria(prompt: str) -> bool
        True when a prompt contains concrete *categorical* criteria (an inclusion
        directive paired with an exclusion directive, or an explicit severity
        rubric), rather than only vague confidence hedges.

    is_vague_instruction(text: str) -> bool
        True when a fragment leans on vague hedges ("be conservative", "only
        high-confidence findings", "use your judgment") that the exam guide calls
        out as insufficient for improving precision.

    severity_rubric() -> dict
        A rubric mapping each severity level to a concrete definition, a real code
        example, and the expected reviewer action.

These functions build *prompts*; none of them call Claude, so there is no client
to inject. The optional live check in the test suite grades a built prompt with
the shared ``grade`` helper.

Grounding (CCAF exam guide, Domain 4):
  * Task Statement 4.1 — explicit categorical criteria beat vague instructions;
    false positives erode trust across every category; define severity with
    concrete code examples.
  * Task Statement 4.2 — few-shot examples are the most effective technique for
    consistent, actionable output; 2-4 targeted examples for ambiguous cases that
    show the reasoning for choosing one action over a plausible alternative.

Precision matters more than recall. A false positive erodes developer trust in
every category, so report an issue ONLY when it clearly matches a REPORT category.
When you are unsure, SKIP it — do not hedge with a low-confidence guess.

## Criteria

### REPORT an issue only when it matches one of these categories:
{report_block}

### SKIP (do NOT report) — these are out of scope:
{skip_block}

## Severity levels
Classify every reported issue using this rubric:
{severity_block}

## Output format
Report each finding with exactly these fields: {fields}.
- location: <file>:<line>
- issue: <one concrete sentence>
- severity: <critical | high | medium | low>
- suggested_fix: <the specific change to make>
If there are no reportable issues, output exactly: No issues found.

## Examples
Study these. Match the output format and the reasoning style precisely, including
how ambiguous cases are decided.
