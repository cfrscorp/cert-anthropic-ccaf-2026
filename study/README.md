# CCAF Study App

A **local, offline, single-user** study app for the Claude Certified Architect –
Foundations (CCAF) exam: a **3-tier practice-question bank** (435 questions —
Standard/Intermediate/Hard, including real multi-response "Select N" items),
**flashcards** (135 cards, with self-graded recall tracking), **concept
explainers**, and a **readiness dashboard** that tracks your progress over time.
No cloud, no accounts, no backend — everything runs on your machine and your
progress lives in your browser (or in a local history file for the CLI/TUI tools).

The content is plain, schema-validated **JSON** (`data/`), driven by a manifest
(`data/sets.json`) that lists every available question/flashcard set; the Web UI
(`web/`, dependency-free HTML/CSS/JS) and the CLI/TUI tools (`tools/`) both read it.

## Install uv

Everything here runs through [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — see the
[install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for all options:

- **macOS** — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`  (or `brew install uv`)
- **Windows** — in PowerShell: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

## Run It

```bash
# From the repo root — uses uv; no extra downloads (serve.py is stdlib-only):
uv run study/serve.py
```

This starts a local server and opens `http://localhost:8000/web/`. Options:

```bash
uv run study/serve.py --port 8123      # pick a port
uv run study/serve.py --no-browser     # don't auto-open
uv run study/serve.py --help
```

**Prefer a downloaded binary?** The app is just static files, so any static server
works — point it at this `study/` directory and open `/web/`:

```bash
caddy file-server --root . --listen :8000
static-web-server -d . -p 8000
miniserve . -p 8000
```

> Why a server at all? Browsers block `fetch()` of local files opened via `file://`.
> Serving over `http://localhost` fixes that and keeps the JSON as editable files.

### Share on Your LAN (LAN-only)

By default the server binds to `127.0.0.1` (this machine only). To share the app with
other devices **on your local network** while keeping it **off the public internet**,
start it bound to all local interfaces on a fixed port:

```bash
uv run study/serve.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Why this stays LAN-only:** home/office routers don't forward inbound connections from
the internet by default, so this only exposes the server to devices on the same network.
Keep it that way with two rules: **(1)** never add a port-forwarding / NAT rule on your
router (and don't use a tunnel like ngrok/Cloudflare Tunnel), and **(2)** scope your OS
firewall to your *private* network (steps below). Only use this on a trusted network
(home/office) — never on public Wi‑Fi (cafés, airports, hotels, conferences).

### Local Access

On the host machine itself, use `http://localhost:8000/web/`. Other devices use
`http://<your-LAN-IP>:8000/web/` (find `<your-LAN-IP>` below — it looks like
`192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`). There is **no authentication** — anyone on the LAN who
opens the URL can view the app (it serves read-only content; each person's progress
stays in their own browser).

### Windows 11

1. **Set the network to Private.** Settings → Network & internet → Wi‑Fi (or Ethernet)
   → click your connected network → set **Network profile type = Private**. (Windows
   only shares on Private networks; Public blocks inbound.)
2. **Find your LAN IP.** Open **Command Prompt** and run `ipconfig`; note the **IPv4
   Address** for your active adapter (e.g. `192.168.1.42`).
3. **Allow the port on the Private profile only.** Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
   and run:
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "CCAF Study (LAN only)" -Direction Inbound `
     -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8000 -Profile Private
   ```
   This permits inbound TCP 8000 on Private networks only — never on Public.
4. **Start the server:** `uv run study/serve.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
5. From another device on the same network, open `http://<IPv4-from-step-2>:8000/web/`.
6. **When done**, stop the server (Ctrl+C) and remove the rule:
   ```powershell
   Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "CCAF Study (LAN only)"
   ```

### macOS 26+

1. **Confirm you're on a trusted private network** (home/office Wi‑Fi or Ethernet), not
   a public hotspot.
2. **Find your LAN IP.** System Settings → Network → select your active Wi‑Fi/Ethernet
   → **Details… → TCP/IP** → note the **IP Address** (e.g. `192.168.1.23`). Or in
   Terminal: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (Wi‑Fi) — try `en1` if that's blank (Ethernet).
3. **Firewall (application-based on macOS).** If the firewall is on
   (System Settings → Network → Firewall), the first time you start the server macOS
   prompts *"Do you want to allow incoming network connections?"* for the Python/`uv`
   binary — choose **Allow**. (You can leave the firewall enabled; under **Firewall
   Options…** the interpreter should be set to *Allow incoming connections*.) macOS's
   firewall has no per-port rules — LAN-only is guaranteed by rules (1) and (2) above,
   not by the firewall.
4. **Start the server:** `uv run study/serve.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
5. From another device on the same network, open `http://<IP-from-step-2>:8000/web/`.
6. **When done**, stop the server (Ctrl+C). Do **not** enable System Settings → General
   → Sharing → *Internet Sharing* (that changes your network exposure).

### Sanity Check & Teardown

- Verify from the host that it's listening on the LAN: another device on the same
  network should load the URL; a device on a *different* network (e.g. cellular, not the
  Wi‑Fi) should **not**.
- Stop sharing at any time with Ctrl+C. The app is fully static/offline — no data leaves
  your network.

## Features

- **Quiz** — scenario multiple-choice (the exam's format), across three difficulty
  tiers (**Standard**, **Intermediate**, **Hard** — pick a set from the dropdown, or
  combine files on the CLI/TUI). Includes real multi-response **"Select N"** items,
  matching the exam's mixed single-/multi-answer format. Each question's answer
  options are reshuffled and relabeled every time it's shown, so repeat practice
  doesn't let you memorize a position instead of the content. Filter by domain / task
  statement, answer, then see the correct choice **and why each distractor is
  wrong**, with a running score and an end-of-set summary.
- **Flashcards** — click-to-flip fact recall (CLI flags, `tool_choice` values, batch
  limits, `stop_reason`, …), each card testing one single concept. Filter by
  domain and task statement, shuffle, and self-grade each card (✓ Got It / ✗ Missed
  It) to drive a "review missed" mode, tracked separately from quiz mastery.
- **Concepts** — one explainer per exam task statement (1.1–5.6): the idea, why it
  matters, the common trap, and a link to the relevant hands-on lab in `../labs/`.
- **Readiness** — a cumulative dashboard: overall readiness % (weighted by the exam's
  domain weights), per-domain and per-task mastery bars, a readiness-over-time
  sparkline, and "revisit lab-NN" suggestions for weak areas.

### Progress Tracking

Progress is cumulative and persists across sessions in your browser's `localStorage`
(no accounts). Because it's browser-local, a different browser/profile or clearing
site data starts fresh — use **Export** / **Import** on the Readiness view to back up
or move your progress, or **Reset** to start over.

## Content Model (`data/`)

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `meta.json` | Domains + exam weights, the 30 task statements, the task → lab map, and `config.app_version` (shown in the Web UI footer). |
| `sets.json` | Manifest of every question/flashcard set (`{id, label, file}`), driving the Web UI's set-picker dropdowns; `quiz.py`/`quiz_tui.py`/`flashcards.py`/`flashcards_tui.py` instead take file paths directly. |
| `questions-standard.json` (240), `questions-intermediate.json` (120), `questions-hard.json` (75, incl. 10 multi-response) | Scenario multiple-choice questions by difficulty tier: stem, 4-5 options (A-E), a `correct` key (a single letter, or a 2+-letter array for a "Select N" item), per-distractor rationale, lab link. All three are schema-identical and interchangeable across every surface. |
| `flashcards.json` | Front/back fact-recall cards (135), each testing a single concept. |
| `concepts.json` | One explainer per task statement (30). |
| `schema/*.schema.json` | JSON Schemas; every data file is validated against these. |

### Adding or Editing Content

Edit the JSON in `data/` (and `sets.json` if adding/removing a whole set), then validate:

```bash
cd study && uv run pytest
```

The tests check schema validity, integrity (valid answer keys, complete distractor
rationales, real task statements, resolvable lab links, weights summing to 100,
the manifest staying in sync with the files on disk), and coverage (question count
per task statement, per-tier minimums) across all three question tiers, all five
domains.

## Command-Line & TUI Tools (`tools/`)

Prefer a terminal? `quiz.py` / `quiz_tui.py` and `flashcards.py` / `flashcards_tui.py`
are standalone, dependency-free scripts offering the same content outside the
browser, with their own cross-session progress history (`.working/`, gitignored).
Each pair shares one "core" data/history module (`quiz_tui.py` and `flashcards_tui.py`
just add a fixed-layout, full-screen rendering mode — same flags, same history file).

```bash
# Quiz: shuffle 20 Hard-tier questions, scoped to one domain
uv run study/tools/quiz.py study/data/questions-hard.json --shuffle --num 20 --domain 1

# Combine tiers, or drill everything you've missed before
uv run study/tools/quiz.py study/data/questions-standard.json study/data/questions-intermediate.json
uv run study/tools/quiz.py study/data/questions-standard.json --review-missed

# Fixed-layout TUI variant (same flags)
uv run study/tools/quiz_tui.py study/data/questions-hard.json --task 4.3

# Flashcards: self-graded recall, filtered to one task statement
uv run study/tools/flashcards.py study/data/flashcards.json --task 3.2
uv run study/tools/flashcards_tui.py study/data/flashcards.json --review-missed

# Full flag reference for any of the four
uv run study/tools/quiz.py --help
```
