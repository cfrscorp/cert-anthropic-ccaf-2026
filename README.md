# Claude Certified Architect – Foundations (CCAF) Exam Prep

Study materials and a hands-on lab program for the **Claude Certified Architect –
Foundations (CCAF)** certification. The exam validates practical judgment about
building production applications with **Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, the
Claude API, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

This repo pairs the official exam guide with a buildable, testable lab curriculum
so you can gain hands-on experience with *every* feature, property, concept, and
topic the exam covers — not just read about them.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| [`anthropic-ccaf-exam-guide-2026.md`](anthropic-ccaf-exam-guide-2026.md) | The exam guide: 5 domains, 30 task statements, 6 scenarios, sample questions, prep exercises. |
| [`labs/`](labs/) | 25 hands-on labs + a shared test harness. Start at [`labs/README.md`](labs/README.md). |
| [`labs/README.md`](labs/README.md) | Master matrix: labs by dependency tier & difficulty, with effort estimates and a full task-statement → lab / scenario → capstone traceability map. |
| [`labs/_shared/`](labs/_shared/) | Reusable test harness (deterministic mock Claude client, `starter`/`solution` switching, opt-in LLM grading). See [`labs/_shared/README.md`](labs/_shared/README.md). |
| [`study/`](study/) | A local, offline study app — practice quiz, flashcards, concept explainers (with code samples), browsable labs, and a readiness dashboard. Run: `uv run study/serve.py`. See [`study/README.md`](study/README.md). |
| `.claude/` | Project Claude Code config (enables the `pyright-lsp` and `agent-sdk-dev` plugins). |

## The lab program at a glance

- **25 labs** across 5 dependency tiers (Foundations → Capstones), ordered so
  prerequisites come first, then by difficulty (1–10). ~48 hours of hands-on effort.
- **Full coverage:** every task statement (1.1–5.6) and every exam scenario (S1–S6)
  maps to at least one lab — see the traceability tables in [`labs/README.md`](labs/README.md).
- **Each lab folder** contains: `README.md` (instructions), `SOLUTION.md` (reference
  key + why-the-distractors-are-wrong), `starter/` (scaffold you fill in), `solution/`
  (reference implementation), `tests/` (automated checks), and any config artifacts
  (`.claude/rules`, `.mcp.json`, `SKILL.md`, CI YAML, sample docs).
- **Tests are deterministic and offline by default:** labs mock the Claude API via
  `labs/_shared/mock_anthropic.py`, so a plain test run needs no API key and costs
  nothing. A handful of inherently semantic checks are marked `llm` and run only when
  you opt in with an API key.

## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — drives all Python scripts and tests (no manual venv needed)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) — for the configuration-oriented labs
- Optional: an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to exercise the live end-to-end and `-m llm` paths

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craigforr/cert-anthropic-ccaf-2026
cd cert-anthropic-ccaf-2026/labs

uv run pytest lab-03-agentic-loop        # test YOUR work on one lab (its starter/)
uv run pytest                            # test your work across all labs
LAB_TARGET=solution uv run pytest        # run the reference solutions (all green)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... uv run pytest -m llm   # add the optional semantic checks
```

Suggested workflow per lab: read its `README.md` (note prerequisites) → fill in
`starter/` until `uv run pytest lab-NN-...` passes → compare against `SOLUTION.md`
and `solution/` for the *why*, not just the *what*.

## Study path

Work the labs in the order given in [`labs/README.md`](labs/README.md) (dependency
tier, then difficulty). Tier 0–1 build the core primitives (agentic loop, tool use,
structured output, Claude Code config); Tier 2–3 layer on error handling,
orchestration, and context management; the Tier 4 capstones integrate everything
into the six exam scenarios.

## Notes

- Derived from the publicly distributed CCAF exam guide.
- Test suite status: `LAB_TARGET=solution uv run pytest` → 376 passed, 3 `llm`-marked
  tests deselected (they run only with an API key).
